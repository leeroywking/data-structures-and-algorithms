# Challenge Summary
Implement a queue

## Challenge Description

###Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.

  * This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to front when the queue is created.
  * Define a method called enqueue which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.
  * Define a method called dequeue that does not take any argument, removes the node from the front of the queue, and returns the nodeâ€™s value.
  * Define a method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located in the front of the queue, without removing it from the queue.

## Approach & Efficiency

No real approach to speak of, its a queue one of the basic datastructures, the approach is mostly to just make it work the way it is expected to.
