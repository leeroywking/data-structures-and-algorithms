# Challenge Summary
Todays challenge was to implement insertion sort

## Challenge Description
Make the psuedo code work and then document appropriately 
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I first tried to understand the problem domain and the described solution and then I wrote it out in a way that made sense to me. (which is why I think my code looks quite a bit different from the psuedocode)

## Solution
No "solution" for this one, its to implement a thing that already works
