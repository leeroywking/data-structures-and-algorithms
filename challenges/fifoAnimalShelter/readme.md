# Challenge Summary
Implement an animal shelter that queues animals and returns the first one that was in

## Challenge Description


* Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.
* Implement the following methods:
  * enqueue(animal): adds animal to the shelter. animal can be either a dog or a cat object.
  * dequeue(pref): returns either a dog or a cat. If pref is not "dog" or "cat" then return null.

## Approach & Efficiency

instantiate two queues and then use some basic logic to grab out the pieces that we need to put the animals in the proper place
